CRPinit
=======

CMS of sorts to allow for the adding, removing, updating and reordering of the CRP company website project listing. Basic CRUD app. Angular on the front end, NodeJS / Express on the back, with Sequelize ORM and MySQL for persistance. PassportJS with the local strategy is used for auth.
